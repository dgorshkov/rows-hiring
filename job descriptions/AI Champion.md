## Intro

Rows is the spreadsheet editor modern teams use to import, transform, and share data. Our mission is to empower the billion people out there working on a spreadsheet every day to work with their own data, making it accessible and actionable for everyone. We build a spreadsheet editor that combines the familiarity of a spreadsheet with modern data ingestion, AI, and sharing capabilities.

## Your role

We are looking for a Full-Time member who can directly generate AI solutions and who will lead our AI strategy. 

Rows has 3 core features powered by AI, and we want you to help us take this to the next level.
1. Our AI Analyst is a side-bar you can summon on any table, that answers your questions and can generate different insights for your data (including generating other tables with different cuts).
2. Our AI functions is a collection of spreadsheets functions that tap into OpenAI (atm only gpt-4o and gpt-35-turbo) for translation, classification, and many other tasks.
3. (Unnanounced project, but you will sh*t bricks when you see it). 

As you can imagine, AI is a cornerstone of our strategy for the next 2 years, and we have strong indications that it works to add value to our users and as a value driver for the business (make money). We believe our AI features will grow in size and strongly impact how we build our product and business.

We currently have a small team working on AI. You may start as a team member or as a lead in the team depending on your experience (TBD). The team currently includes 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 PM (who doubles as an expert prompt engineer) that for the past year all have been allocated roughly 50% to our AI efforts.
