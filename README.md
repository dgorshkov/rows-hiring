### At Rows we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone.

Imagine a spreadsheet grid where each cell can also call an API or repeat a job. This is what we are building. Our product lets users create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills they already have.

Rows raised a $16m series B round led by Lakestar (with past investors Accel Partners and Cherry Ventures - which led our $8m series A in 2018). We are hiring for our Porto office (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany).
