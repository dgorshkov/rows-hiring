The Rows organization is divided in teams (we call them Cells!).

Teams have a mission - a driving goal that provides clarity over the long term. 

**We are remote-first, but we also have an office in Porto (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany).**

At Rows, teams enjoy a lot of ownership.
- For example, decisions inside Product teams are taken as a group by the local Product Manager, Engineering Manager (Engineers) and Design.
- We see Functions as the providers of technical guidance. They are excellence centers from which recommendations and technical feedback originates.

We have now started to structure our team around similar teams. Each group has a domain and a Manager (a mini-CEO of sorts).

| Group                 | Domain                                | Teams      |
